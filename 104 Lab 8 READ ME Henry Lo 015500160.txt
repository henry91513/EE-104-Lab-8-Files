# YoLo Model Creation
	Through this section, we are required to use yolo model image identification training to 
identify the images and categorize them into different classifications. We are also required to 
create new classifications including a non-train object and two teammates. Through the increasing
numbers of the echo, the Yolo model's accuracy will generally increase allowing it to identify 
objects and persons. Yet, even with finished training, sometimes unpredictable errors still
occur during the identification  


# Dacing Game Development 
To make sure you can play this game without any problem, please ensure all the pictures are in 
the image file, and all the mp3 files are in a music file. Remember to put dance.py, images, 
and music in the same place. This game is a two-player game. The first player uses the up, down, 
left, and right keys to dance. Player two use W, A, S, and D key to dance. After the countdown, 
the program will list a random dance move you must follow, follow the dance move by pressing the 
right key to win the score and beat your friends on this optimate dancing battle.
